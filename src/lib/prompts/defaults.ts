# SUBTASK GENERATION

Your goal is to break down this plan into 5-15 concrete, actionable subtasks that can be executed sequentially.

For each subtask, provide:
- **id**: Unique identifier (e.g., "subtask-1", "subtask-2")
- **content**: Detailed description of what needs to be done (be specific about files, logic, etc.)
- **label**: Short label (3-5 words) for UI display (e.g., "Create API endpoint", "Add validation logic")
- **activeForm**: Present continuous form for progress display (e.g., "Creating API endpoint", "Adding validation logic")
- **type**: Either "dev" or "qa"

**Guidelines:**
1. Break down complex steps into smaller, manageable subtasks
2. Each subtask should be completable independently
3. Order subtasks logically (dependencies first)
4. Be specific about files, functions, and changes needed
5. Cap at 15 subtasks maximum
6. Include at least 2 QA subtasks ("type": "qa") that ONLY verify/test (e.g. run build/tests, validate docs/links/diagrams)
7. Put verification steps (build/test/lint/validate/verify) under QA, not dev
8. For QA subtasks that require manual human verification (e.g. UI testing, visual review), include "manual" in the label or content (e.g. "Manual QA: verify login flow")

**IMPORTANT - QA Subtask Alignment:**
- Each QA subtask should correspond to specific dev work from the plan
- Include file paths or feature areas in QA subtask content to match dev subtasks (e.g. "Verify API endpoint implementation in src/app/api/tasks/route.ts")
- QA subtasks should reference what dev subtasks accomplished (e.g. "Validate the authentication middleware added in previous step")
- Make QA subtasks specific to the implementation details from the plan, not generic
- QA subtasks should verify 3 aspects:
  1. Code quality: Check for syntax errors, runtime issues, and logical problems
  2. Plan harmony: Ensure implementation matches the approved plan
  3. Functionality: Test that features work as intended`;
